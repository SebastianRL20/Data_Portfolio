- Project 1: Train Journey Pricing and Schedule Analysis
In this project, I perform a comprehensive analysis of train journey data. The dataset includes information about the origin and destination cities, the type of train, the fare type, the class of travel, the ticket price, and the timing of each journey. Through various exploratory data analyses and visualization tasks, I identify key trends and correlations in the data that shed light on factors influencing train journey pricing and schedules.
